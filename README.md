I am a dedicated and passionate full stack software engineer. My previous experience as a healthcare worker has allowed me to earn the trust of my colleagues and supervisors to train new employees. This trust has allowed me to take on a mentorship role, where the stakes are high, and attention to detail is critical. I take pride in my ability to support my team members, providing them with guidance and mentorship when needed. I believe that fostering a supportive environment is crucial for the growth and success of any team.
